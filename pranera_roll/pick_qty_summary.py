"""
pranera_roll/pick_qty_summary.py

Keeps Roll Pick Assignment.pick_qty_summary (the per-UOM breakdown added
by patches/v1_1/add_pick_qty_summary.py) — and the underlying pick_qty
grand total that the tolerance-based free-scan flow already reads
(api/pick_order.py, RollWisePickOrderExecutionPage.vue) — in sync with
batch_items whenever it's used.

Registered as a "validate" doc_event against "Roll Pick Assignment" in
hooks.py — a doctype this app doesn't own (it belongs to Textiles And
Garments), the same pattern already used for the "Stock Entry" doc_event
below it, which likewise reaches into a doctype owned elsewhere.

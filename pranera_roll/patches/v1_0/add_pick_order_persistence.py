"""
pranera_roll/patches/v1_0/add_pick_order_persistence.py

Adds server-side persistence for an in-progress Pick Order Execution
session, so a worker can close the app mid-scan and resume later without
losing what they already scanned (previously: everything lived only in
the browser's Pinia store and was wiped on unmount / page refresh).

Adds:
  1. A new child doctype "Roll Pick Assignment Scan" — one row per roll
     scanned against a Roll Pick Assignment that hasn't been submitted
     yet.
  2. Three new fields on "Roll Pick Assignment":
       - scanned_rolls              (Table -> Roll Pick Assignment Scan)
       - execution_source_warehouse (Link -> Warehouse)
       - execution_target_warehouse (Link -> Warehouse)
     The execution_* fields hold the worker's current choice at execution
     time, separate from the supervisor-set source_warehouse /
     target_warehouse on the Assignment itself — the worker can override
     either if the rolls are actually sitting somewhere else, or the
     material needs to land somewhere else, without changing the
     original Assignment.

Created as a genuine app-owned DocType (via this patch, guarded by an
exists() check) + Custom Fields rather than a production-only tweak —
see the note at the top of api/pick_order.py on why this app avoids
that pattern.

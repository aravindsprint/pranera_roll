"""
pranera_roll/patches/v1_1/add_pick_qty_summary.py

Extends Roll Pick Assignment / Roll Pick Batch Item — owned by the
Textiles And Garments app, not this one — via Custom Fields + a Property
Setter only. Same non-invasive pattern as
patches/v1_0/add_pick_order_persistence.py, so this app never forks
another app's DocType source.

Adds:
  1. "Stock UOM" on "Roll Pick Batch Item" — fetched from Batch.stock_uom
     (itself fetched from the batch's Item on the Batch doctype already),
     read-only.
  2. A Property Setter so "batch_items" also shows on the Roll Pick
     Assignment form for pick_type == "To Work Order" (previously: From
     Batch / To Sales Order only). Batch restriction for "To Work Order"
     picks is optional and was already supported server-side
     (api/pick_order.py's scan_pick_order_roll, since commit
     "Optional batch restriction for To Work Order pick orders") — the
     form just never showed the field for that pick_type, so a
     supervisor had no way to actually populate it.
  3. A new child doctype "Roll Pick Qty Summary" (uom, total_qty) and a
     new read-only Table field "pick_qty_summary" on Roll Pick
     Assignment. Batches named in batch_items can carry different Stock
     UOMs, so a single summed Pick Qty number would silently mix units —
     this shows the total broken out per UOM instead. Kept in sync by
     pranera_roll.pick_qty_summary.set_pick_qty_summary, registered as a
     "validate" doc_event in hooks.py (see that file for why a doc_event
     is the right mechanism for a doctype this app doesn't own).

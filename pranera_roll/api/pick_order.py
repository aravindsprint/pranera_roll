pranera_roll/api/pick_order.py
Server-side whitelisted methods for the "Roll Pick Assignment" flow.

Copied from pranera_roll/api/pick_order.py for the standalone Roll app —
only the worker-side execution endpoints used by "My Pick Orders" and
"Pick Order Execution" are kept (get_my_pick_orders, get_pick_order_detail,
update_pick_order_execution, scan_pick_order_roll, remove_scanned_roll,
submit_pick_order). The supervisor-side "Create Pick Order" endpoints are
not part of this app. References below to "knit.py" now mean
api/roll_pick.py in this app.

Roll Pick Assignment is a purpose-built doctype owned entirely by this
app (pranera_roll/knit_module/doctype/roll_pick_assignment) — not an
extension of another app's doctype, to avoid the cross-app drift issues
this app has hit before (Server Scripts and Custom Fields that only
existed on production and were never fixture-exported).

A supervisor sets a target weight (pick_qty) for a Work Order rather than
pre-selecting exact rolls — the worker free-scans rolls until the
cumulative picked weight falls within a +/-3% tolerance of that target.
Roll weights vary in the real world, so hitting an exact target
roll-by-roll isn't practical — a tolerance band is.

Validations that run on every scan:
  1. Packed & manufactured — the roll must appear in at least one submitted
     Roll Packing List whose Stock Entry field is set (i.e. it's actually
     been packed against a real, submitted Stock Entry — normally the
     Manufacture entry that produced it) — not just a bare Roll record
     that was created but never went through packing. A cut roll (e.g.
     "31873-1", split off "31873" by the separate Cut Rolls feature)
     never gets its own Roll Packing List row — only the roll it was cut
     from does — and the Roll doctype has no field linking a cut roll
     back to its parent, only the "<parent>-<n>" naming convention. So
     this check also walks that suffix off the scanned roll_no and
     accepts a match on any ancestor in the chain.
  2. Project match (pick_type == "To Work Order" only) — the roll's
     Project must match the target Work Order's Project, so material
     doesn't get misrouted into an unrelated project's job.
  3. Batch match (whenever the Assignment is tied to a Work Order) — if
     the supervisor named specific batches (batch_items rows — optional
     for "To Work Order"), the roll's batch must be one of those. Other-
     wise it must be one this Work Order actually produced, per the
     is_finished_item rows of its own submitted Stock Entry (Manufacture)
     — not just any batch of the same item code sitting in the warehouse.
  4. No duplicate scan — a roll can't be scanned twice, either within
     this in-progress session or against a prior submitted session for
     this same Assignment.

There is deliberately NO check that Roll.warehouse matches the selected
Source Warehouse — Roll.warehouse is only ever pushed forward by
roll_wise_pick_list_events.py, scoped to a different app's Stock Entries,
so it's frequently stale for a roll's actual current location and isn't a
trustworthy gate. What gets recorded against the scan is the batch's own
per-batch warehouse override from the Assignment's Batch Items table when
one is set (get_batch_warehouse_overrides, in knit.py), since that's the
specific place the supervisor identified for that batch; otherwise it
falls back to the worker's currently selected blanket Source Warehouse
(see scan_pick_order_roll).

The +/-3% tolerance itself is enforced authoritatively server-side, in
knit.create_roll_picking_entry (not here) — that's the single point where
an Assignment's fulfillment actually becomes a real Stock Entry, so
that's where the final check has to live; a client-side-only check could
be bypassed by calling the API directly.

── Session persistence ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every scan is written immediately to the Assignment's own scanned_rolls
child table (see patches/v1_0/add_pick_order_persistence.py), not just
held in the browser's Pinia store. That means a worker can close the app,
lose signal, or come back the next shift, reopen the same Assignment, and
see exactly what they'd already scanned — nothing is lost until the final
submit_pick_order() call, which is also the only place scanned_rolls gets
cleared. execution_source_warehouse / execution_target_warehouse are the
worker's current, persisted choice for this session — they default to the
Assignment's own source_warehouse / target_warehouse but can be changed
independently (e.g. rolls turned out to be sitting somewhere else, or the
material needs to land somewhere other than originally planned) without
touching the original Assignment fields.
